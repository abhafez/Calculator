# FCC Calculator
this project is one of freecodecamp front-end program advanced projects which tests javascript skills and ability to find solutions when the programmer faces obstacles.
In this project I used vanilla javascript as a challenge and no use of any library.

## eval() function
this function saved alot of time with it calculates a string and return the results.

e.g : var x = "5+5"

eval(x) // returns 10
